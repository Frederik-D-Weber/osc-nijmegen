## Goals

- meet new colleagues and have fun
- improve www.openscience-nijmegen.nl
- learn new skills along the way
- spur new project ideas

## Some basics
- everyone is welcome to join
- [registration](https://forms.gle/mWaCpnQ1ncTqF9Kn7) is not mandatory, but very helpful to the organizers
- you can stay as long as you want/can
- we (organizers) will provide coffee and food during the break

### What are the prerequisites? :white_check_mark:

There really only is one:

*Bring your own laptop* (or, well, whatever device you're comfortable working
with) that you can connect to the internet.

### On-site workflow :repeat:

- you work on any way you like (e.g. writing in google docs or your text favourite editor)
- once you're happy with your work, you create a [pull request (PR)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) to [our repository](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen)
- somebody reviews your contribution
- after a successful review, contribution is live!
- go back to step one :blush:

### Timeline :clock3:

(14.45-15.00 site setup, krank-up laptops, finding plugs :electric_plug: etc.)

15.00-15.10 :coffee: coffee and intro  
15.10-16.00 :wrench: doing (see possible contributions below)  
16.00-16.10 :pizza: break, stretch, food! (or keep on doing)  
16.00-16.50 :wrench: more doing (see contributions below)  
16.50-17.00 :tada: wrap up and plan ahead  

## How can you contribute?

### Contents :pencil:

Contribute by writing new contents and updating existing ones. No coding skills needed. Just eagerness and team spirit ðŸ˜Š

Example issues (those with 'contents' tag):
-	[code of conduct](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues/14)
-	[populate OS resources tab](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues/6) (find links)
-	mention OSC Netherlands in about
-	write contributing guidelines
-	[review and proofread links subpage](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues/15)
-	create a contributors page (see example)
-	your original issue :blush:

### Website functionality :nut_and_bolt:

Feel like the website is missing something (a button somewhere for something, a tab
for something somewhere?). Jump right in. Tackling these issues will will be easiest
if you are familiar with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). We're using the [Minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) Jekyll template.

Example issues:

- optimize landing page
- test search functionality
- explore options for analytics (yes/no)
- your issue :blush:

### Website organization :bookmark:

If you're happy with buttons and search bars, but think we're missing out on
something altogether, give your contribution here. The current organization is a
result of on-the-go building, so there's certainly room for improvement.

Example issues:

-	[explore options to have a member profiles page](https://github.com/Radboud-University/osc-nijmegen/issues/16)
-	create member initiatives (sub)page
-	do we want a blog/news subpage?
-	can we have a tag system?
-	devise a system for categorizing contributions
-	your very own issue :blush:

### Other :watermelon:
By definition, we don't know what we could do here. But you might. If so, shoot!
