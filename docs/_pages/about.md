Open science community Nijmegen (OSCN) is a community of researchers and other academic workers devoted to maintaining and developing scientific practices that ensure transparency, rigour, and reproducibilty of academic work(flow). Although the target audience are academic workers from Nijmegen, OSCN considers itself a part of a global open science movement (see [Links](https://radboud-university.github.io/osc-nijmegen/_pages/links/)).
