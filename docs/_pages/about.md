## Who are we?

Open science community Nijmegen (OSCN) is a community of researchers and other academic workers devoted to maintaining and developing scientific practices that ensure transparency, rigour, and reproducibilty of research and related academic work (the term 'science' is used in its broadest, inclusive sense to include humanities and social sciences). Although the target audience are academic workers from Nijmegen, OSCN considers itself a part of a global open science movement (see [Links](https://radboud-university.github.io/osc-nijmegen/_pages/links/)).

## What is open science?

There is no single definition of 'open science' that would cover the variety of principles and practices associated with it, however, the following definition from the [Open Science Trainging Handbook](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/) provides a useful starting point:

> Open Science is the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.

Examples of 'open science practices' therefore include, among other, the practice of conducting preregistrated studies (i.e. transparency w.r.t. planned analyses), sharing research data and resources (e.g. computer code) required to reproduce the results, transparency in evaluation of scientific work (e.g. open peer review), ensuring free access to published work, etc. (for more, consult 'Educational resources' under [Links](https://radboud-university.github.io/osc-nijmegen/_pages/links/))

In OSCN, we do not distinguish 'open' science from 'traditional' science ('Open science is just science done right', the slogan goes) as many of the practices briefly outlined in the preceeding paragraph are best viewed as desirable default scientific behaviours which have to various degrees, taken forms that undermine. The challenge, however, remains just how are we to implement the principles and set up the desired default practices and to ensure active academic workers in local communities receive training to engage in these practices without a significant overhead that would impede their core research. This is where the [goals and activities](https://radboud-university.github.io/osc-nijmegen/_pages/goals/) of the OSCN come in.
