**What:** Official launch event of OSC Nijmegen. ðŸŽ‰

There will be a series of lightning talks from members of open science community.
We hope this will not only give you an idea of what kind of open science practices are already in place, but will leave you inspired to get a head start on your own open workflow.

**Where**: Red Room of the Trigon Building (Kapittelweg 29, 6525 EN Nijmegen)
